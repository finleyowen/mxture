            | We are a public and moderated community blog dedicated to fostering a safe and supportive 
            | space for the exploration and expression of queer identities and ideas. Here, we provide 
            | a platform for members of the trans and gender-diverse communities, as well as anyone whose
            | exploration of gender doesnâ€™t sit comfortably or solidly within the traditional gender binary, 
            | to feel represented and empowered to contribute to the conversation. We invite you to join
            | us in this journey of discovery and exploration!
